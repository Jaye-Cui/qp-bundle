The various software components included in the QP-bundle are
licensed as follows:

QP Frameworks
=========
The QP Real-Time Embedded Frameworks (RTEFs) are licensed under the
dual-licensing model, in which both the open source (GPL) and traditional
closed source software distribution models are combined.

****
NOTE: If your company has a policy forbidding open source in your
product, all QP frameworks can be licensed commercially, in which
case you don't use any open source license and you do not violate
your policy.
****

For more information about licensing the QP RTEFs, please see:

QM Modeling Tool
===========
The QM Model-Based Design tool is freeware. It is free to download
and free to use for any purpose, including commercial projects,
but is not open source. During the installation you will need to
accept the basic End-User License Agreement (EULA), which legally
protects Quantum Leaps from any warranty claims, prohibits removing
any copyright notices from QM, selling it, and creating similar
competitive products based on QM. For more information about
licensing QM, please see:

- https://www.state-machine.com/qm/license.html

****
NOTE: QM internally uses the Qt Toolkit under the GNU Lesser General
Public License (LGPL). Please refer to qm\qt_lgpl (compliance with
LGPL) for more information on how to obtain, install, and build the
Qt toolkit from sources.
****

The Code Generated by QM
----------------------------
The code generated by QM is licensed under the same dual-license
model as the underlying QP framework, for which the code has been
generated.

By default, the QM code generator assumes that the underlying QP
framework is used under the open source GNU General Public License
(GPL), and for compliance with the GPL, QM generates the required
top-level file comments.

However, when the underlying QP framework is licensed commercially,
the Licensee receives a QM License Certificate file, which can be
registered with QM by means of the Code Generation License Dialog Box.
After registering a commercial license, QM generates top-level file
comments that reflect the commercial license terms.
